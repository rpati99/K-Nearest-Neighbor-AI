# K-Nearest-Neighbor-AI

I have added the logic in code.ipynb file. 
This project aims to implement the K-nearest neighbor algorithm taught by Dr. Eamonn Keogh. 
It uses search algorithm wrappers namely. 
1. Forward Selection
2. Backward Elimination

To provide an overview of performance of K-NN with respective dataset namely:- 
1. Small with 12 features and 500 instances.
2. Large with 50 features and 5000 instances.
I measured them and can be visualized with plotting graphs (scatter plot and bar graph) outlining accuracy vs features.
