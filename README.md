# K-Nearest-Neighbor-AI 

This project aims to implement the K-nearest neighbor algorithm taught by Dr. Eamonn Keogh. 
It uses search algorithm wrappers namely. 
1. Forward Selection
2. Backward Elimination

To provide an overview of performance of K-NN with respective dataset namely:- 
1. Small with 12 features and 500 instances.
2. Large with 50 features and 5000 instances.

Visualization of the performance of the codee done by plotting graphs (scatter plot, bar graph) outlining accuracy of respective features.
• Scatter plot shows accuracy for all feature sets. 
• Bar chart shows accuracy of best feature sets. 

Under "Logs" folder, output of program is available.
Under "code.ipynb" notebook code logic is present.
