# K-Nearest-Neighbor-AI 

**This project aims to implement the K-nearest neighbor algorithm taught by Dr. Eamonn Keogh. 
It uses search algorithm wrappers namely.**

- Forward Selection
- Backward Elimination

**To provide an overview of performance of K-NN with respective dataset namely:**
- Small with 12 features and 500 instances.
- Large with 50 features and 5000 instances.

**Visualization of the performance of the codee done by plotting graphs (scatter plot, bar graph) outlining accuracy of respective features.**
- Scatter plot shows accuracy for all feature sets.
- Bar chart shows accuracy of best feature sets. 

*Under "Logs" folder, output of program is available.*

*Under "code.ipynb" notebook code logic is present.*
